# Implementation Summary - 5 Takes Game

## Overview
Complete implementation of the 5 Takes card game as a local multiplayer terminal application. All four main phases have been completed successfully.

## Architecture

### Core Game Logic (`src/game/`)
- **`card.py`**: Card class with value and point calculation, Deck class for shuffling/dealing
- **`player.py`**: Player class managing hand, selections, and scores
- **`table.py`**: Table and Row classes handling card placement rules
- **`rules.py`**: GameRules class with all validation and game rule logic
- **`game.py`**: Main Game class coordinating rounds, turns, and game state

### User Interface (`src/ui/`)
- **`colors.py`**: Terminal color management with colorama
- **`display.py`**: GameDisplay class for all visual output formatting
- **`input.py`**: InputHandler class for all user input with validation

### Main Controller (`src/`)
- **`main.py`**: GameController orchestrating the complete game flow

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Complete Game Rules
- 104 cards (1-104) with proper point calculation
- Scoring: 1 base, +1 for multiples of 5, +2 for 10s, +4 for 11s, +6 for 55
- 4-row table with 5-card maximum per row
- Proper card placement: next higher value in closest row
- Forced row selection when card is too low
- Row wiping when 5th card placed

### ✅ Local Multiplayer
- Support for 3-10 players
- Hot-seat gameplay with device passing prompts
- Privacy handling with screen clearing between players
- Simultaneous card selection with reveal
- Turn-based row choices when needed

### ✅ Terminal UI
- Colorful display with card point-based coloring
- Clear game state visualization
- Table and hand display
- Score tracking (round and total)
- Input validation with error messages
- Pass-device prompts for privacy

### ✅ Game Flow
- Complete round management (10 turns per round)
- Game end when player exceeds 50 points
- Winner determination (lowest score)
- Play-again functionality
- Proper game state tracking
